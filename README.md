# Discord-ChallengerBot-30min
This Discord bot was developed to practice programming and testing bot functionalities in Discord. The bot is currently equipped with a simple slash command that reacts to the /ping command and responds with "Pong". More slash commands are needed to unleash the full potential of the bot.

# The challeng
the challenge is that you code another 'slash' command within 30 minutes. if the command works, create a pull request. so go ahead and expand the bot according to your ideas. i am looking forward to your ideas.
